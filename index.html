        </header>
        <p>
          I am a passionate and dedicated full-stack web developer with a strong
          foundation in both backend and frontend technologies. With a deep
          understanding of Java and Spring Boot, I build robust, scalable, and
          efficient backend systems that power seamless user experiences. On the
          frontend, I bring designs to life using React, creating dynamic,
          responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My journey in web
          development is driven by a love for crafting clean, maintainable code
          that solves real-world problems. I thrive in environments that
          challenge me to push my boundaries, whether it's optimizing backend
          performance, implementing complex frontend features, or ensuring that
          every piece of code aligns with best practices. With a focus on
          continuous learning and improvement, I stay updated with the latest
          trends and technologies in the web development world. My goal is to
          create digital experiences that not only meet the needs of users but
          also exceed their expectations.
